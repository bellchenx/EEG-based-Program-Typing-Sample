# EEG-based Program Typing Sample
This sample only works on Emotiv Epoc+ sensor and the function of keyboard simulation only works on macOS.
I integrated LSTM-RNN sequence prediction and Word2vector model which need to be trained by many codes that you want to complement. You might connect your EEG sensor by USB adaptor or Bluetooth.
